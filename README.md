# BlackJackConsoleGame
A simple console program to mimic a game of BlackJack


This was a college project in my first semester of a C# based programming module 

Project Brief

Create a program which mimics a game of BlackJack or 21.  
The rules are you need to have a hand less than or equal to 21. 
An Ace is worth 11 and Jack, Queen and King are all worth 10.  
The dealer deals you two cards and you can decide to stick or twist.  
You can receive a card until you stick or go bust (over 21).  When you have decided to stick the dealer deals two cards. 
If he has less than 17 he takes another card and repeats until he has more than 17 or is bust.  
You then compare your score with the dealers, the highest wins.
